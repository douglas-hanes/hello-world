# hello-world
Beginning repository as an interface to the world.

Hi.  I'm currently a research biostatistician in the Providence research 
network, based in Portland, Oregon.  I work within the Cardiovascular 
Analytics, Research + Data Science group, but my current activity is 
primarily in support of cancer research.

I have a Ph.D. in math and many years of health research experience, 
in neuroscience, clinical trials, and behavioral medicine.  
Most of my programming is in R.

Thanks.
